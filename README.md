# Integer-Stack
The Stacklist program allows users to input integers into a stack, which are then sorted and displayed. It demonstrates basic stack operations and sorting in Java.
Input Handling: Accepts integer inputs from the user until the input "done" is entered.
Stack Operations: Uses Java's Stack class to store integers.
Sorting: Utilizes Collections.sort() to sort the stack in ascending order
Output: Prints both the original and sorted stacks.
